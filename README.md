# TrumpSentimentAnalysis


## Project Title 
This is a statistical and sentiment analysis of Donald Trump's Tweets from his Twitter. Trump's tweets were pulled from Twitter using an API in RStudio. The tweets were cleaned up and some common words as well as some carefully selected "controversial" words were used as our indicator variable. A Sentiment score (Positive - Negative Words) was also calculated for each tweet. Multiple linear regression and Poisson regression was utlized in this project.

## Motivation
We were curious if including certain words in his Tweets would influenced the number of retweets he got.

## Instructions
File is a RMarkdown file and should be opened in RStudio
